# Description
Explore the fascinating world of cellular automata (CA) through this Java-based simulation project. Cellular automata involve a grid of cells, each with a finite state, which evolve over time based on predefined rules. In our simulation, these rules are constant, and each cell interacts with its eight neighboring cells. To add complexity, we've introduced four distinct life forms: mycoplasma, salmonella, virus, and bacteria, each exhibiting unique behaviors, resulting in a dynamic and diverse simulation.

## Why Cellular Automata? 
Cellular automata find applications in diverse fields, from geography and anthropology to political science, sociology, and physics. By studying these automata, we gain insights into complex systems and their behavior.

## Key Features:

Simulate cellular automata with diverse life forms.
Observe the change of cell states based on fixed rules.
Explore the wide-ranging applications of cellular automata.


## Getting Started
